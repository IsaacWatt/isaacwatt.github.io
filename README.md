Code files for my personal website.

Additionally, some of my smaller projects are included in the repository so that people can easily use and check out some of my smaller apps. These include [Patatap clone](http://isaacwatt.me/Patatap/circles.html) and [RGB game](http://isaacwatt.me/rgb%20project/colour.html).
